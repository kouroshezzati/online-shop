to add product go to admin page with root path 'http://localhost:3000/', but
you need to login before go to admin page.
for login enter `aco@gmail.com` for email input and `123` for password input;
you can add a product and the number of the product that are exist. we assume all
the products are `active` and are not expired.
there are already 3 product types exist in the app, but you can add as much as you want.
the 'http://localhost:3000/shop/' is the page that's public and you can visit the products
and also define how many items to be shown, by default it shows all the items without any filter
base on weight.
